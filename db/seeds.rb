In the early 1900s, it was known for its thriving distilleries and breweries. After those industries declined, it experienced a long period of blight through the 1970s and 1980s. Now the neighborhood is seeing a renaissance, as artists pushed out of Williamsburg and elsewhere move in and raise property values. Bushwick offers unconventional living spaces: The housing market is full of converted lofts in old factories, sometimes with great access to outdoor space.", flood_zone: Faker::Number.between(from:1, to: 10))
neigh_2 = Neighborhood.create!(neighborhood_name: "Park Slope", image: "https://www.nycgo.com/images/articles/9650/park-slope-01-joe-buglewicz-7499__large.jpg" ,about: "Park Slope has a tranquil, easygoing vibe and can almost feel suburban. Strollers and children of all ages are a constant presence on sidewalks, as are shoppers patronizing local boutiques and dog walkers heading up to the park. Residents are Brooklynites through and through and tend to be socially conscious, artistically minded, and committed to their community. At night, a casual restaurant scene comes alive. For anyone looking for a night out, there are plenty of beer gardens and wine bars to patronize, especially in the South Slope.", flood_zone: Faker::Number.between(from:1, to: 10))

During the day, however, the neighborhood slows down and has a tranquil feel. Meander down a leafy side street, and you'll happen upon plenty of prewar buildings and rusting fire escapes, which lend the East Village its old-fashioned charm.", flood_zone: Faker::Number.between(from:1, to: 10))

The E, F, M, R, and 7 trains; the Long Island Rail Road; the Brooklyn-Queens Expressway; and the Long Island Expressway all run through Elmhurst, making Manhattan accessible in 20 minutes. This surfeit of commuting options also contributes to a decidedly frenetic feel, with the constant buzz amplified by Elmhurst's busy commercial scene. There are two malls here, along with countless big-box stores, groceries, medical offices, and restaurants. In fact, the wealth of eateries makes this one of the city's best neighborhoods for culinary exploration.", flood_zone: Faker::Number.between(from:1, to: 10))

Relative obscurity has kept rents low for decades, although that appears to be slowly changing as brownstone families are priced out of Park Slope and Carroll Gardens. A new wave is beginning here: Industry City, a cluster of 16 warehouses on cobblestone streets, now hosts Smorgasburg, The Brooklyn Flea, and Mister Sunday, a day dance party in the summer. The galleries, tech conferences, rooftop movie screenings, and countless artisan shops in that complex are slowly putting Sunset Park on the map for young people.", flood_zone: Faker::Number.between(from:1, to: 10))

Popular with young professionals and students, the neighborhood is vibrant, thriving, and decidedly down-to-earth. Expansive parks make it a popular place for dog owners. At its core, the neighborhood has always been diverse; throw into the mix plenty of Columbia Med School students in scrubs and off-duty cops, and that will round out the scene at many a happy hour in the Heights.", flood_zone: Faker::Number.between(from:1, to: 10))

The nightlife, restaurant and music scene have burgeoned in recent years as energy and activity in Williamsburg creeps north towards Greenpoint. As a result, the neighborhoodâ€™s low-key, tucked-away vibe may not last for long, although poor access to public transportation may deter some new residents. Despite all the recent change, Greenpoint still hangs onto its rich history and an old-school community.", flood_zone: Faker::Number.between(from:1, to: 10))

From this vantage point, you can see the canal clearly cutting through the heart of the neighborhood and spreading out from it are lots teeming with scrap metal, concrete mixing plants, and lumberyards. The polluted canal became a Superfund site for long-term clean up in 2009, and the area surrounding the waterway was rezoned for residential development.", flood_zone: Faker::Number.between(from:1, to: 10))
